# Spring students management

RESTful students management system where users can sign up or login and make crud operations with students built with Spring ecosystem.
I made this project on purpose of apply and expand my Java and Spring framework knowledge

## Getting Started

These instructions will give you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on deploying the project on a live system.

### About the application

This is a simple web application that follows the Representational State Transfer principles. This application uses Maven as the build tool and the current LTS version of Java, 17. I hope to add more functionality to this application in the future but for now this project uses the following dependencies:

- Spring Security
- Spring Web
- Spring Data JDBC
- Thymeleaf
- MySQL Database

### Running the application

You can run this application from your favorite IDE or by running the following command:

    ./mvnw spring-boot:run

## Future features
These are some features that I plan to add to the project so that it scales little by little and eventually becomes a robust project:
- [ ] User logout
- [ ] Success and failure messages
- [ ] Only admins can make CRUD operations to students
- [ ] In-page forms

And more
